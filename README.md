# Wireless Debug VS Code Extension

A Visual Studio Code extension to simplify wireless debugging of Android devices using ADB pairing and connecting commands.

## Features

- Lists your active network IP addresses for easy selection
- Prompts for device IP (last digits only) and port number based on your network
- Supports ADB wireless debugging pair code input
- Provides commands to pair and connect your Android device wirelessly
- Works with system hotspot and standard Wi-Fi networks

## Requirements

- [ADB (Android Debug Bridge)](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) must be installed and added to your system PATH
- Your Android device should have **Wireless Debugging** enabled and show a pairing code

## Usage

### Commands

- **Wireless Debug: Pair Device**  
  Starts the pairing process:  
  1. Select your network IP (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)  
  2. Enter the last digits of your device IP (e.g., `45`) and port number (usually `5555`)  
  3. Enter the 6-digit wireless debugging pair code shown on your Android device  
  4. Optionally connect immediately by entering device port number again  

- **Wireless Debug: Connect to Device**  
  Connects to your device without pairing:  
  1. Select your network IP  
  2. Enter the last digits of your device IP and port number  
  3. Connects via `adb connect ip:port`  

### Running the commands

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)  
2. Type and select `Wireless Debug: Pair Device` or `Wireless Debug: Connect to Device`  
3. Follow the prompts  

## Example

If your network IP is `192.168.1.1`, device IP is `192.168.1.45`, and port is `5555`:

- Select `192.168.1.1` from network list  
- Enter `45` for last digits of device IP  
- Enter `5555` as port number  
- Enter the 6-digit pair code from your device (for pairing)  
- Optionally connect immediately  

ADB commands run under the hood:

```bash
adb pair 192.168.1.45:5555
# (pair code sent as input)
adb connect 192.168.1.45:5555
```
